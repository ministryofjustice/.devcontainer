This documentation is for teams and individuals who wish to integrate [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/) into their development workflow.

## Our Goals

The goal of the community is to provide a consistent and reliable development environment for all developers throughout the Ministry of Justice.

Development Containers are already in use across the organisation. The Development Container community is an effort to bring together the knowledge and experience of those who have already implemented Development Containers and to provide a platform for sharing that knowledge with others.

Development Containers in use across the Ministry of Justice are noted [here](https://github.com/search?q=org:ministryofjustice+path:**/devcontainer.json&type=code).
