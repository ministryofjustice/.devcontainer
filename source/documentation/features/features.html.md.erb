## What are Features?

In the context of the Ministry of Justice Dev Containers community, features are built by the community to satisfy the specific needs of our developers and the challenges they face on a day to day basis.

Features are built using the [.devcontainer](https.//github.com/ministryofjustice/.devcontainer/features/test) GitHub repository and are designed to be modular and reusable.
