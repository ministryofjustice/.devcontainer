## What are Features?

In the context of the Ministry of Justice Development Container community, features are built by the community to satisfy the specific needs of our developers and the challenges they face on a day to day basis.

Features created in the Dev Container community are described [here](https://containers.dev/features) both can be consumed when constructing a Dev Container. From this point on, we will refer to these features as "Community Features" and Ministry of Justice feature as "Features".

Features are built using the [.devcontainer](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/.devcontainer/features/test) GitHub repository and are designed to be modular and reusable. This means that features can be combined to create a custom development environment that meets the needs of a specific project or team.

Features are can be used by Sofware Developers and those in Operations Roles to create consistent and reliable development environments for the applications and services they work on.
