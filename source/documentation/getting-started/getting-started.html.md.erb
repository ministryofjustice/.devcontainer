Official documentation is located [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container).

## Adding a Development Container to a Project

1. Create a `.devcontainer` folder in the root of your project.
1. Add a `devcontainer.json` file to the `.devcontainer` folder.
There are a number of parameters which can be included in a devconatiner.json file, these are noted in detail [here](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/).
1. Populate the `devcontainer.json` file with the required settings:

```json
{
  "name": "devcontainer-example",
  "image": "ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/devcontainer-base:latest"
}
```

In the example above, the `name` parameter specifies the name of the development container, and the `image` parameter specifies the base image for the development container.

The `ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/devcontainer-base` image is an extension of `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:ubuntu-24.04`. The enhancements are documented [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/.devcontainer/blob/main/images/base/Dockerfile).

## Consuming Ministry of Justice Features

Ministry of Justice Features are described [here](../features/features.html).

To consume a feature, add the feature to the `features` array in the `devcontainer.json` file. An example of this is shown below:

```json
{
  "name": "devcontainer-example",
  "image": "ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/devcontainer-base:latest",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/devcontainer-feature/container-structure-test:0": {},
    "ghcr.io/ministryofjustice/devcontainer-feature/static-analysis:0": {}
  }
}
```

In the example above, the `features` array includes the `docker-in-docker`, `container-structure-test`, and `static-analysis` features. Note that the `docker-in-docker` feature is a community feature, while the other two features are Ministry of Justice features. Both types of features can be consumed in the same way.
